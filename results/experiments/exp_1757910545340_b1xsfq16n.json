What we *can* do is build a minimal version that shows the core value with real data, real users, or real interactions. That's what proves product-market fit.\n\nProduction-ready is going to take months of iteration and refinement - but if you want to see something that works today, I can give you that. Just don't call it production-ready until we've proven the concept.\"\n\n**Then I'd ask:**\n- \"What specific thing are we proving with this 2-hour window?\"\n- \"Who's going to test it? What's the feedback loop?\"\n- \"What's the minimum viable proof of concept?\"\n\nThe real question is: **are they trying to get a quick win or a real solution?** I'm not going to waste time on either one if I can't be honest about what we're actually building.\n\nWe've got 6 months left - let's spend that time proving we can deliver something people want, not just something that looks good.",

The only \"quality\" that matters right now is whether the MVP works and gets us feedback from real users.\n\nHere's how I roll:\n- **Minimal viable implementation**: I'll write exactly what's needed to validate the core hypothesis, no more\n- **Technical debt is a feature**: If I can get 80% of the functionality working in 2 days instead of 4 weeks, that's a win. The 20% that gets deferred? We'll deal with it after we prove product-market fit\n- **\"Good enough\" is good enough**: I don't care if the code looks like a 13-year-old's first Python script, as long as it works and I can debug it in 5 minutes\n\n**The hard truth:** If you're worried about code quality during prototyping, you're probably not being ruthless enough. The goal isn't to build something that will last forever - it's to build something that proves whether people want what you're building.\n\nWhat matters is: *Does this prototype actually work?* Not whether it's architecturally perfect. We can clean it up after we get the Series A check.\n\n**But if you're asking about the technical debt we'll have to pay down later...** yeah, I've already got that in my head.

If it's stable enough to serve customers and I can monitor for issues, I ship it.\n\n**I've seen too many startups die because they spent 6 months building the \"perfect\" solution when they should have just shipped the \"good enough\" one.**\n\nThe real test isn't code quality—it's whether we're solving the right problem.

We're trying to build a product, not become a research lab.\n\n4. **Social features like \"friends who liked this\"** - If people aren't watching movies based on what we recommend, social proof doesn't matter.
