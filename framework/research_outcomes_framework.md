# Research Outcomes Framework

## Core Question: What Makes This Research Worth Our Time?

The goal is to extract actionable insights about how different personas fundamentally approach problems, creating a practical understanding that can be applied to future prompting strategies.

## Primary Research Deliverables

### 1. Persona Behavioral Taxonomy
**Output**: A clear categorization of how different personas think and act
**Value**: Know which persona archetypes to reach for in different situations

**Categories to Map**:
- **Risk Tolerance Spectrum**: From "ship broken code" to "perfect or nothing"
- **Scope Management Styles**: Minimalist vs comprehensive vs contextual
- **Time Relationship**: Sprint mentality vs marathon planning vs context-dependent
- **Quality Philosophy**: "Good enough" vs "best practices" vs "it depends"

### 2. Persona Prediction Matrix
**Output**: "If I say X to persona Y, they'll likely do Z"
**Value**: Predictable outcomes from different prompting approaches

**Matrix Structure**:
```
Scenario → Startup Founder → Research Student → etc.
"Build quickly" → Scope minimal → Prototype focus →
"Be thorough" → Context-dependent → Comprehensive →
"Time pressure" → Cut corners → Prioritize learning →
```

### 3. Language Pattern Dictionary
**Output**: Specific words/phrases that trigger different behaviors in each persona
**Value**: Precision prompting - know exactly what language gets what results

**Categories**:
- **Activation Words**: Phrases that make persona more effective
- **Deactivation Words**: Phrases that push persona toward default behavior
- **Neutral Words**: No behavioral change
- **Contradiction Words**: Phrases that confuse the persona

### 4. Context Sensitivity Map
**Output**: Understanding which personas are most/least influenced by additional context
**Value**: Know when to add backstory vs when it's wasted effort

**Measurements**:
- Baseline behavior without context
- Behavior with minimal context
- Behavior with rich contextual backstory
- Consistency across different context levels

## Secondary Research Insights

### 5. Self-Awareness Analysis
**Question**: Which personas accurately predict their own behavior?
**Value**: Trust levels - know which personas mean what they say

### 6. Prompt Resistance Study
**Question**: Which personas are most susceptible to being overridden by explicit instructions?
**Value**: Understand persona "strength" and when to rely on them vs explicit constraints

### 7. Edge Case Behavior Mapping
**Question**: How do personas handle contradictory or unclear instructions?
**Value**: Robustness assessment for real-world usage

## Practical Application Framework

### The "Persona Selector" Decision Tree
Based on research outcomes, create a simple decision tree:

```
Need quick proof of concept?
├─ Yes → Startup Founder or Research Student
│  └─ High uncertainty? → Research Student
│  └─ Clear goal? → Startup Founder
└─ No → [other decision branches]
```

### The "Language Optimizer" Lookup Table
Quick reference for effective prompting:

```
Want minimal scope with Startup Founder?
✓ Use: "MVP", "validate hypothesis", "time to market"
✗ Avoid: "comprehensive", "enterprise ready", "scalable"
```

### The "Context Calculator"
Guidelines for when to add persona backstory:

```
High-context personas: Worth investing in rich backstory
Low-context personas: Save time, use basic persona
```

## Success Metrics for the Research

### Immediate Success Indicators:
1. **Predictability**: Can we predict persona behavior 80%+ of the time?
2. **Differentiation**: Do personas produce meaningfully different outputs?
3. **Controllability**: Can we reliably steer persona behavior with language?

### Long-term Success Indicators:
1. **Practical Adoption**: Do we actually use these insights in future prompting?
2. **Time Savings**: Faster iteration cycles with better initial prompts
3. **Outcome Quality**: Better alignment between intent and AI output

## Research Output Structure

### Final Deliverable: "Persona Prompting Playbook"
**Format**: Practical reference guide with:
- Quick persona selector based on task type
- Language optimization cheat sheets for each persona
- Context investment guidelines
- Common failure patterns and how to avoid them

### Supporting Analysis Documents:
1. **Raw Data Analysis**: Full behavioral breakdowns
2. **Pattern Recognition Report**: Cross-persona insights
3. **Failure Case Studies**: When personas didn't work as expected
4. **Validation Tests**: Proof that insights actually work in practice

## ROI Calculation

**Investment**: ~4-6 hours of systematic testing
